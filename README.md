# simplecov-cobertura 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dashingrocket/simplecov-cobertura.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dashingrocket/simplecov-cobertura)   [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/simplecov-cobertura.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/simplecov-cobertura)  [![Downloads](http://ruby-gem-downloads-badge.herokuapp.com/simplecov-cobertura?type=total)](https://rubygems.org/gems/simplecov-cobertura)

Produces [Cobertura](http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/) formatted XML from [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov).

Output can be consumed by the [Jenkins Cobertura Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin) for easy 
coverage visualization.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simplecov-cobertura'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simplecov-cobertura

## Usage

```ruby
require 'simplecov-cobertura'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::CoberturaFormatter
```

Run your test suite. Coverage information will be saved to `coverage/coverage.xml` by default.

### Parallel Testing

If you use `parallel_tests` gem, then each test process writes coverage information to `coverage/coverage.xml` file at the end of the execution. The last process overwrites the file after all previous processes. Only coverage of the last process remains.

A solution is to write each process coverage to its own file. Similar to how test database names are formed - with the `TEST_ENV_NUMBER` environment variable - you can set coverage output file name:

```ruby
SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::CoberturaFormatter.new(filename: "coverage#{ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER']}.xml")
```

After running 4 parallel test processes, you will get 4 coverage reports:

```
coverage/coverage1.xml
coverage/coverage2.xml
coverage/coverage3.xml
coverage/coverage4.xml
```

NOTE: Set the `PARALLEL_TEST_FIRST_IS_1` environment variable to get this numbering. Without it, the first process will be unnumbered.

If you run a single test process without the parallel tasks, you will still get a single `coverage/coverage.xml` file.
